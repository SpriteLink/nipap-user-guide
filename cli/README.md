CLI
===
NIPAP comes with two user interfaces, the web interface and a command line interface (CLI). In this section we will explore the latter and you will learn everything from the basic operations of the CLI to more advanced use cases.

While graphical interfaces, such as a web interface, offer low barrier of entry for new users and good overview of a lot of data they might not always be the fastest way around as each action can involves numerous clicks and forms. CLI's on the other hand typically lack some of the intuitiveness of a graphical user interface but can be considerably faster for an experienced user.
