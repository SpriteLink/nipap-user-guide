# Removing a pool
To removing a pool is as simple as removing a prefix.

All prefixes are dismembered from the pool, they do not belong to a pool
anymore:

```
user@host $ nipap pool remove test-linknets
Do you really want to remove the pool 'test-linknets'? [y/N]: y
Pool 'test-linknets' removed.

user@host $
```
